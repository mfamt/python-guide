# Move Fast and Make Things in Python

_A practical guide to building things with Python_ - by [Dan Nguyen](http://danwin.com), Stanford Lecturer in Computational Journalism



### About MFAMT: Python

For my Computational Journalism courses at Stanford, I believe Python is the language most accommodating to the range of students I teach: some are engineering/CS majors and have gone through [Stanford's CS offerings](http://www-cs.stanford.edu/) for Java, C, C++, and Rails. Others are in the [masters journalism program](http://journalism.stanford.edu) and have at least programmed in [MySQL](http://www.padjo.org/tutorials/), if not [Unix](http://www.compciv.org/curriculum).

I'm writing the __MFAMT Guide to Python__ for both the experienced programmer new to the Python language, and the novice programmer who hasn't yet had a formal CS education. Their common goal is the need to expansively explore and filter data, and to efficiently build and publish works of journalism.



### Contents

The MFAMT guide is divided into two sections:

- __Lessons__: A quick overview of basic Python syntax, convention, and programming fundamentals
- __Recipies__: Practical guides in accomplishing both small and large real-world tasks.
