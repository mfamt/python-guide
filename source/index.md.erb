# Move Fast and Make Things in Python

_A practical guide to building things with Python_ - by [Dan Nguyen](http://danwin.com), Stanford Lecturer in Computational Journalism



### About MFAMT: Python

For my Computational Journalism courses at Stanford, I wanted a concise and practical guide to Python syntax and conventions geared toward the students I work with. Some students are engineering or computer science majors and just need a pocket reference for Python, as they have already gone through [Stanford's CS offerings](http://www-cs.stanford.edu/), which include Java, C, and Rails. Other students are in the masters journalism program, and by now have at least programmed in [MySQL](http://www.padjo.org/tutorials/), if not [Unix](http://www.compciv.org/curriculum), but lack a formal background in computer science theory and software engineering practices.

The MFAMT: Python guide was created to fill the gap. It's not meant to be replace an actual computer science education. At a minimum, readers are expected to appreciate the discipline and mindset of programming, particularly the attention to detail and the ability to think in abstractions. The MFAMT guide is simply meant to reduce the time it takes to get things done in Python.
