### The immunizations site

The [live site](http://stash.compjour.org/sites/www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/immunize/pages/immunizationlevels.html). 

The [mirror site](http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/immunize/pages/immunizationlevels.aspx).

Why make a mirror? Because the site may change its layout, or even remove files, in the next month or year. By making a mirror, I can have better assurances that this exercise will work in the future.


Mirror of the page was created with __wget__:

~~~sh
wget --recursive --page-requisites --convert-links \
--level=1 --reject=pdf \
http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/immunize/pages/immunizationlevels.aspx
